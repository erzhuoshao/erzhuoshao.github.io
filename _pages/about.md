Welcome!

I'm currently pursuing my doctoral research at the [Kellogg Center for Science of Science and Innovation](https://offices.northwestern.edu/detail/856) at Northwestern University, where I have the privilege of being mentored by [Prof. Dashun Wang](https://www.dashunwang.com/). As an alumnus of Tsinghua University, I hold a B.Eng. and M.S. in Electronic Engineering, where I was advised by [Prof. Yong Li](http://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/). Additionally, I earned an M.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University. My research interests are centered around Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Data Science. At present, I'm enthusiastically exploring the potential of Large Language Models to enhance our scientific understanding.
