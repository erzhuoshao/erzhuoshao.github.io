Welcome!

I am pursuing master's degree in Electronic Engineering Department of Tsinghua University and Biomedical Engineering Department of Johns Hopkins University. I am warking in [Future Intelligence (FIB) LAB](http://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/index.html) and advised by [Dr. Yong Li](http://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/). I was also a research assistant at [Computational Approaches to Human Learning (CAHL) research lab](https://github.com/CAHLR) in UC Berkeley and advised by [Dr. Zachary Pardos](https://gse.berkeley.edu/zachary-pardos). My research interests focus on Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Data Science.
